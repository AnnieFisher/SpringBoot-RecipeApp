# SpringBoot-RecipeApp
This is a simple recipe app I created to work with multiple aspects of Spring.
I used Spring 5 framework with SpringBoot, SpringData, SpringJPA, and SpringMVC. I utilized the H2console, then configured the use of mySQL within a docker container. I utilized unit testing with Mockito for best practices for TDD. I also incorporated project Lombok to reduce boiler plate code. I used the thymeleaf template engine for my view layer.
